# WhatsAnalyzerWeb

**Analyze and visualize your WhatsApp Chats!**

With this program you can get insight into all your WhatsApp chats, including group chats!

## Features

* Average messages per day
* User message count + total message count
* Conversation start count per user (how often did someone write the first message of the day)
* Average words per message per user
* Messages per weekday / hour
* Most common words per user (excluding common german words, see globals_.py)
* Most common Emojis per user
* Media count
* Link count
* HTML report with plots + display in Terminal

## Limitations

Currently the texts are only in German. Furthermore, since the format of the exported chat will probably vary from region to region, you might run into errors. If you have problems, please contact me, as I intend to improve compatibility in the future.
